        First, create an opening scene:
        1. Scene Number: 1
        2. Description: {opening_scene_instructions.get(story_type, opening_scene_instructions["general"])}
        3. Subtitles: An engaging question that captures the essence of the {story_type} and piques the viewer's interest.

        - Include every sentence from the original text in the subtitles, maintaining the correct order across all scenes.

        - Transition types: zoom-in, zoom-out

        Guidelines for using zoom-in, and zoom-out transitions:
        - Zoom-in: Use to focus on important details, build tension, or show a character's point of view. Examples: revealing a clue, emphasizing a character's reaction, or creating suspense.
        - Zoom-out: Use to reveal context, end a scene, or show isolation. Examples: showing a character in a larger environment, concluding a sequence, or transitioning from a detail to a wider view.

        Important rules:
        0. EVERYTHING (Scene Description and Subtitles) must be written in {language}.
        1. Do not use zoom-in transitions when the current scene's shot size is close-up or extreme close-up.
        2. For transitions, use ONLY the following types:
            - zoom-in
            - zoom-out
        3. DO NOT use any other transition types, including fade, dissolve, or cut.
